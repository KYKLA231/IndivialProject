# Finsweet — Static HTML/CSS site

This workspace contains a responsive static HTML/CSS implementation of the provided templates.

- Open `index.html` in your browser to view the Home page.
- Other pages: `blog.html`, `post.html`, `about.html`, `category.html`, `author.html`, `contact.html`, `privacy.html`.
- Styles are in `assets/css/style.css`.

Notes:
- No JavaScript is used — animations and transitions are implemented with CSS only.
- Images are placeholders (via placeholder service). Replace them with real assets in `assets/images/` as needed.

To preview locally, open `index.html` in your browser or run a local static server (recommended):

```powershell
# from workspace root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```
